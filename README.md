# meccanoid-rspi
!!!!!!!
I was not able to get Python implementation to work yet. I suppose due to the python latency.
Use it only as a reference for this time.
To solve this problem, I'm going to make implementation in C/C++ and then wrapped it with Python.
!!!!!!!

Initially I planned to make Meccanoid library for RaspberryPi only but as there are quite a lot of good alternatives, I'm going to make it depending on generic GPIO interface only, so that other platform can be easily added.

I've choosen two programming languagues for C++14(maybe C++17)/Python3. 
At first stage I will add raspberryPi, as planned, then one of the x86 boards.

I've also renamed the project from meccanoid-rspi to meccanoid-gpio.

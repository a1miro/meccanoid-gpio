# meccanoid-rspi
Initially I planned to make Meccanoid library for RaspberryPi only but as there are quite a lot of good alternatives, I'm going to make it depending on generic GPIO interface only, so that other platform can be easily added.

I've choosen two programming languagues for C++14(maybe C++17)/Python3. 
At first stage I will add raspberryPi, as planned, then one of the x86 boards.

I've also renamed the project from meccanoid-rspi to meccanoid-gpio.
